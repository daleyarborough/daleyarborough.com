      <hr><hr>
      <ul>
        <li>S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a place to store files in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Object based storage (flat files). Designed to widthstand failure, with high availability and durability. 
          <br/>
          Files can be from 1Byte up to 5TB. Files are stores in "buckets"
          <br/>
          Read and Write access for PUTS of NEW objects; Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
          <br/>
          Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform. Amazon guarantees 99.99% availability; 99. (11 x 9's) durability
          <br/>
          Tiered storage available. Lifecycle Management. Versioning. Encryption. Secure data with "bucket policies and access control lists.
          <br/>
          S3, S3-IA, Glacier (long retrieval time, usually 3-5 hours | used generally for data archival, 
          <br/>
          RRS (use case: data you can generate again -- image files in one bucket, and thumbnails in another (RRS)
          <br/>
          Things charged for when using S3: Storage, Requests, Storage Management Pricing, Data Transfer Pricing, Transfer Acceleration
          <br/>
          File Gateway - for flat files, stored directly in S3
          <br/>
          Volume Gateway 
            <ul>
              <h4>Volume Gateway</h4>
              <li>Stored Volume</li>
              <li>Cached Volume</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CDN: Content Delivery Network (network of servers that deliver web page to users all over the world)
        <br/>
        Edge Location: The location is where content will be cached
          <br/>
          Origin: origin of all files that CDN will distribute -- S3 bucket, EC2 instance, Route53, or Elastic Load Balancer with EC2 instances behind it
          <br/>
          Security and Encryption: In-Transit measures (TSL -- transport socket layer): 
          <br/>
          SSE-S3 (enabled when object is created; AMZN handles all keys and regularly rotates keys),
          <br/>
          SSE-KMS (Envelop Key -- added protection against unauthorized access to your keys, and logs key access), SSE-C (Customer creates and manages keys)
        </li>
        <li>VPC | Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</li>
	      <p>Private IP Address Range CIDR -- 10.0.0.0/16</p>
	      <p>Three Private Address Ranges -- 10.0.0.0/0 (10/8 prefix), 172.16.0.0 (172.16/12) prefix, 192.168.0.0 (192.168/16 prefix)</p>
	      <p>Two routes of entry -- Internet Gateway (how we connect to internet), Virtual Private Gateway (where we terminate our VPN connections)
		      <block>Where we can have site-to-site connection between a VPC and a datacenters. </block>
	      </p>
	      <p></p>The router then routes to AWS Route Tables, followed by Network Access Control Lists (referred to as second line of defense),
	      <br />
	      and finally into the different subnets, whether it is a Private Subnet or a Public Subnet.
        <li>ONE Subnet can only span ONE Availability Zone, but Security Groupds, Route Tables, Network ACL's can span multiple Availability Zones</li>
	      <p>You will then launch your EC2 instances inside these Subnets, whether DB or application servers in private, or web servers in public</p>
	<li>Network Access Control Lists are stateless, meaning that if you allow traffic in from port 80 (http) or 443 (https),
		<br />
		then you must also create a rule allowing it back out again</li>
	<li>Each EC2 Instance comes with a Private IP and a Public IP by default. VPC Subnets default to having route OUT to internet</li>
        <li>VPC Peering | Allows multiple VPC's in a Region to connect and communicate them through Direct Connect via Private IP's</li>
	<li>VPC is in "Star Configuration", meaning there is no such thing as "Transitive Peering" 
		<block>IE : Each VPC connections has to be set up seperately! Not a middle VPC that talks to all</block></li>
	<li>Security Groups are STATEFUL, Network Control Access Lists (NACL) are STATELESS</li>
	<li>Amazon S3 : Scaleable storage in the cloud
	      <br />
	    Amazon Glacier : Low-cost archive storage in the cloud
	      <br />
	    Amazon EBS : Persistent block storage volumes for Amazon EC2 virtual machines
	      <br />
	    Amazon EC2 Instance Storage : Temporary block storage volumes for Amazon EC2 virtual machines
	      <br />
	    AWS Import / Export : Large volume data transfer
	      <br /
	    AWS Storage Gateway : Integrates on-premis IT environments would cloud storage
	      <br />
	    Amazon Cloudfront : Global content delivery network (CDN)
	      <br />
	    Amazon SQS : Message queue service
	      <br />
	    Amazon RDS : Managed relational database server for MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft, and SQL Server
	      <br />
	    Amazon DynamoDB : Fast, predictable, highly-scaleable NoSQL data store
	      <br />
	    Amazon ElastiCache : In-memory caching service
	      <br />
	    Amazon Redshift : Fast, powerful, fully-managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service
	      <br />
	    Databases on Amazon EC2 : Self-managed database on an Amazon EC2 instance
	</li>
	<li>An Internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows
	      <br />communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet. It therefore imposes no availability risks or 
            bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. An Internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route
	      <br />
            tables for Internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses
	      <br />
             To use an Internet gateway, your subnet's route table must contain a route that directs Internet-bound traffic to the Internet gateway
	</li>
	<li>Technical Benefits of the Cloud : 
	      <br />
	    Automation : "Scriptable infrastructure" instead of physical infrastructure
	      <br />
	    Auto-scaling | (ie: auto scaling groups with instances located in different availability zones within a region, that create a fail-resistant environment
	      <br />
	    Proactive Cycling Scaling : Periodic scaling that occurs at fixed interval (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
	      <br />Proactive Event-Based Scaling : Scaling just when you are expecting a large surge of traffic requests due to a scheduled business event
	      Auto-scaling based on demand : By using a monitoring service, your system can send triggers to take the appropriate actions so that it scales up 
	      <br />or down based on metrics (utilization of the servers network I/O, for instance)
	      <br />
            More Efficient Development : Being able to update features or lifecycles -- continuous improvement
	      <br />
	    Improved Testability
	      <br />
	    Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
	      <br />
	    "Overflow" the traffic to the cloud
	</li>
	<li>MySQL installations default to port number : 3306, SSH : 22, RDS : 3389(?), HTTP : 80, HTTPS : 443</li>
	<li>As the AWS platform is PCI DSS 1.0 compliant, I can immediately deploy a website to it that can take and store credit card details. I do not need to get any kind of delta accredditaion from a QSA. FALSE</li>
	<li>What is the maximum response time for a Business Level Premium Support Case? : 1 Hour</li>
	<li>Auditing user access/API calls etc across the entire AWS estate can be achieved by using; : CloudTrail</li>
	      <li>If I want to run a database on an EC2 instance, which is the most recommended Amazon storage option? : EBS</li>
	      <li>Can I <em>MOVE</em> a reserved instance from one region to another? No</li>
	      <li>In RDS what is the maximum size for a Microsoft SQL Server DB Instance with SQL Server Express edition? : 10Gb</li>
	      <li>When creating a new security group, all <em>IN BOUND</em> traffic is allowed by default. : EBS</li>
	<h3>Security in the Cloud consists of :</h3>
	<br />
	  <li>Data protection -- least privilege access system | Encryption in transit (SSL)/ encryption at rest | CloudTrail -- detailed logging of changes and file access
	      <br />Versioning can protect against accidental overwrites or similar harm
	      <br />You can encrypt your data both in transit and at rest using; ELB, EBS, S3, and RDS</li>
	  <li>Privilege management : [Access Control Lists (ALS's), Role Based Controls, Password Management (password rotation policies)]
	      <br />
	      Typically securing accounts using IAM, MFA</li>
	  <li>Infrastructure protection : How are you using Keys and Credentials -- Really looking at how you've configured your VPC, ports, individual IP addresses, bastion hosts, NAT instances, etc.</li>
	  <li>Detective controls : AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, Amazon Cloud Watch</li>
	<h3>Reliability in the Cloud consists of :</h3>
	  <li>Foundations : IAM, VPC</li>
	  <li>Change management : AWS CloudTrail</li>
          <li>Failure management : CloudFormation, RDS-multiAZ (where you can force a "failover" from your primary to your secondary in the concole itself)</li>
	<h3>Performance Efficiency Pillar :</h3>
	  <li>Compute : Autoscaling</li>
	  <li>Storage : EBS, S3, Glacier</li>
          <li>Database : RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift</li>
	  <li>Space-Time Trade-Off : CloudFront, Elasticache, Direct Connect, RDS Read Replicas - reduce latency</li>
	<h3>Cost Optimization :</h3>
	  <li>Matched supply and demand : Autoscaling for demand</li>
	  <li>Cost-effective resources : EC2 (reserved) instances, AWS Trusted Advisor</li>
          <li>Expenditure awareness : CloudWatch alarms, SNS</li>
	  <li>Optimizing over time : AWS Blog, AWS Trusted Advisor</li>
	<h3>Operational Excellence Pillar : Includes operational practices and procedures used to manage production workloads</h3>
	  <li>Preparation : </li>
	  <li>Operation : </li>
          <li>Response : </li>
	      <p>Workloads should have : RUNBOOKS -- Operation guidance that operations teams can refer to so they can perfrom normal daily tasks
	      <br />
	      AND
	      <br />
	      PLAYBOOKS -- Guidance for responding to unexpected operational events. 
		      <br />
		      Playbooks should include response plans, as well as escalation paths and stakeholder notification</p>
	      <br />
	      <p>AWS Key Services - Preparation : AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of AWS resources and configuration, and continuously records
	      <br />
	      configuration changes. AWS Service Catalog helps to create a standardized set of offerings that are aligned to best practices. Designing
	      <br />
	      workloads that use automation with services like Auto Scaling, and Amazon SQS, are unexpected operational events.</p>
	      <p>AWS Key Services - Operations : AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline can be used to manage and automate code changes to AWS workloads
	      <br />
	      Use AWS SDK's or third-party libraries to automate operational changes. Use AWS CloudTrail to audit and track changes made to AWS environments
	      <br />
	      </p>
	      <p>AWS Key Services - Responses : Take advantage of all of the Amazon CloudWatch service features for effective and automated responses. Amazon CloudWatch
	      <br />
	      alarms can be used to set thresholds for alerting and notification, and Amazon CloudWatch events can trigger notifications and automated responses
	      <br />
	      </p>
	      <p>Kinesis : Used to consume big data, stream lots of social media, news, feeds, logs, etc.
	      <br />
	      Process large amounts of data;
	      <br />
	      - Redshift for business intelligence
	      <br />
	      -Elastic Map Reduce for Big Data Processing</p>
	      <p>EBS backed volumes are persistent and can be detached and attached to other EC2 instances | volumes can be stopped and data persists 
	      <br />
	      Should be used for long term data storage, and instance storage should not be used for long term data storage
	      <br />
	      Instance Store backed voumes are not persistent (ephemeral)</p>
	      <h3>VPC Peering Limitations</h3>
	      <p>You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPC's that have matching or overlaping CIDR blocks.
	      <br />
	      You can not create a VPC peering connection between VPC's in different regions.
	      <br />
	      VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships</p>
	  <li>In a virtual-hosted–style URL, the bucket name is part of the domain name in the URL. For example:  
              http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
	      <br />
              http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com.
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      In a path-style URL, the bucket name is not part of the domain (unless you use a region-specific endpoint). For example:
	      <br />
              US East (N. Virginia) region endpoint, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket
	      <br />
              Region-specific endpoint, http://s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com/bucket
	  </li>

            <li></li>
	  </ul>
<!-- Amazon EC2 instances are grouped into 5 families: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, GPU, and Storage Optimized instances. General Purpose Instances have memory to CPU ratios suitable for most general purpose applications and come with fixed performance (M4 and M3 instances) or burstable performance (T2); Compute Optimized instances (C4 and C3 instances) have proportionally more CPU resources than memory (RAM) and are well suited for scale out compute-intensive applications and High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads; Memory Optimized Instances (R3 and R4 instances) offer larger memory sizes for memory-intensive applications, including database and memory caching applications; GPU Compute instances (P2) take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA Tesla GPUs for high performance parallel computing; GPU Graphics instances (G2) offer high-performance 3D graphics capabilities for applications using OpenGL and DirectX; Storage Optimized Instances include I3 and I2 instances that provide very high, low latency, I/O capacity using SSD-based local instance storage for I/O-intensive applications and D2, Dense-storage instances, that provide high storage density and sequential I/O performance for data warehousing, Hadoop and other data-intensive applications. When choosing instance types, you should consider the characteristics of your application with regards to resource utilization (i.e. CPU, Memory, Storage) and select the optimal instance family and instance size. -->
